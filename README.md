# Boxify
ENGR 372 project. A website tailored towards the warehousing business. Allows users to a) organize their shipments into the optimum number of boxes and pallets, and 
to calculate the shipping costs of their cargo
further features possibly to add. a) the optimmum method of shipping, the price of the shipment & shipping providers. (not in the scope of the university course, instead
these are features which I could add in the future)
