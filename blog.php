            <span class="title"> Organize Floor Plan for Optimum Process Flow </span>
            <span class="text"> An organized workspace should provide a safe environment for your employees and be highly efficient. 
                        The flow should be set up in the order of operations. For example, inventory comes in from Receiving and moves on to 
                        Storage either in one or multiple zones based on storage method. Once orders have been picked, they are packaged and 
                        sent to shipping and out the door.</br></br></span>
                <span class="ellipsis"> Poll your staff who work in the space on a daily basis.Are there small corners of the warehouse which can be adjusted 
                        slightly to support their efforts? Enable your staff to speak up during this process improvement. Keeping your employees
                        safe and happy is highly beneficial to their productivity and your overall success.</span>

    <span class="title"> Classify Inventory </span>
            <span class="text"> Start by classifying your inventory to ensure you’re organizing even your slowest moving items accordingly. 
                            Profiling your stock keeping units or SKUs should be supported by data. Take inventory of what is currently 
                            in your warehouse (size, shape, quantity) and how often it moves or frequency of picking. This will help you 
                            organize your inventory into categories: your fast (A), medium (B), slow (C) and very slow (D) movers. 
                            </br></br></span>
                <span class="ellipsis">The ABC analysis for classifying inventory enables you to organize the distribution of various goods 
                    within your warehouse according to their importance for the business, their value, and their turnover. This method 
                    prioritizes the procurement and placement of products not by volume or quantity, but rather by the economic contribution 
                    they make to the company.</br></span>

    <span class="title"> Strategies To Minimize Waste And Save Money In Warehousing </span>
            <span class="text">  Many companies underestimate how much waste they are producing, and the true cost of that waste on the business.
                Typically, the cost of waste is between 4-5% of company turnover, but it can reach as high as 10%. This means that warehouses 
                can save thousands of dollars by focusing on the greatest waste reduction.</br></br></span>

                <span class="ellipsis">To calculate the true cost of waste for your operations, you should take into account the costs of 
                    packaging, labor, energy, storage, transport and lost margin, as well as disposal costs.</span>

            <span class="title"> 7 benefits of using a warehouse management system </span>
            <span class="text"> Manufacturers, retailers, and other businesses that need to keep track of what’s going on in warehouses 
                and similar facilities can benefit from using a warehouse management system (WMS). These tools help in a variety of ways,
                ranging from gaining visibility into your inventory levels to finding ways to optimise the warehouse stocking process. 
                In turn, that helps businesses operate more efficiently, often to the benefit of employees, customers, and the bottom line.

    <span class="title">expert tips on improving warehouse efficiency & productivity </span>
            <span class="text">Most warehouse operations are on an ongoing mission to maximize the productivity process by optimizing workflows,
                automating processes and reducing waste (both time and resources). Warehouses are complex operations with many moving parts and
                functions happening simultaneously, so while there are plenty of areas to improve warehouse productivity, it’s not always easy 
                to determine where your efforts will pay off. </br></br></span>

                <span class="ellipsis">Advances in logistics technology, such as automated robots, have a big impact on warehouse productivity, along with innovative AI and machine 
                learning solutions, sophisticated warehouse management software and other technology solutions. Taking a look at your current processes and 
                systems to identify bottlenecks and other concerns, implementing process improvements and making smart technology investments that address your 
                key challenges puts organizing a warehouse and improving warehouse productivity within reach.</span>

            <span class="text"> Wholesalers and distributors have a lot of things on their hands. And we mean a lot of things.
                Aside from juggling the day-to-day demands of the business and ensuring an orderly movement of orders through 
                your workflow, you need to deal with designing, organizing and maintaining a property that’s probably second 
                in importance to your own home — your warehouse.There’s little point if your star sales reps are pulling in 
                orders only to see them picked and packed incorrectly or goods are received incorrectly. </br></br></span>

                <span class="ellipsis"> 
                    Your warehouse is the last stop before the final mile to your customers. Treat it right and you’ll enjoy a smoother workflow 
                    and deliver a far better customer experience.</span>

            <span class="text"> Lean principles are typically associated with manufacturing operations — in fact, lean manufacturing was 
                originally developed by engineers at automaker Toyota and helped the company become one of the most efficient manufacturers 
                on the planet. But lean manufacturing approaches can also be adopted effectively in the warehouse.A lean approach focuses on the elimination of waste: wasted employee motion, excessive inventories,
                    unnecessary transportation,  etc.</br></br></span>
